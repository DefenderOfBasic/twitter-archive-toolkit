# visakanv (April 6, 2021)

I really struggle to give an accurate answer to "what is the book that changed your life the most", because the thing that changed my life, honest, honest, I swear, is all of the books in aggregate. there is no one book that stands out, because every book is part of every other

read 100 books, and 100 more, and 100 after that- https://t.co/3LAHIPwdsQ

every book hits a certain way depending on the context of the reader. how do I explain how The Dark Is Rising hit me when I was 13, or When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, or The Chocolate War- I can't promise you that any of those books will hit you the same way

# blisstweeting (May 13, 2021)

Name one book you read as if in your past life which left an imprint that defines something in you even today?

Mine is "The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses" by @jesseschell. These lenses have changed a lot in me.

I started juggling not in the last place because of this book. Never went with it to the level of performing in public (not to say making money) but juggling has become a very pleasant pastime for me. Also bonus points for my brain learning skills.

I just remembered that for a good chunk of my childhood my favorite book was an adaptation of homer‚Äôs odyssey for children, Ulysses. I had three copies and read them over and over. I should re-read it ü§î

Come to think of it, my mom bought me so many unexpected books. I had a picture book biography of Kant?!

# the_wilderless (March 30, 2021)

If I‚Äôm being more honest about this one, the key turning point would probably be The Raw Shark Texts. Cuz that one led me to House of Leaves, which changed my view on literature, and Murakami, which changed my view on life. https://t.co/XrDj7RYl0l

Oh yeah, it also led me to Satan Burger, which altered my writing a tooonnnnnnn. 

And prolly led me to read philosophy, which was a whole thing. 

So most of the reading that‚Äôs changed me the most is downstream from Raw Shark Texts (even though I don‚Äôt actually love that book)

# drmaciver (March 7, 2021)

What are your favourite books about books?

Prompted by the fact that I picked up a copy of "How to use books" partly as a joke, and I'm actually unironically really into it. I'm also a big fan of "How to talk about books you haven't read" and a highly caveated fan of "How to read a book".

I've also got a huge soft spot for "A book of book lists" and enjoyed "The year of reading dangerously".

I think I just in general really like books about books TBH.

what‚Äôs a book that you don‚Äôt want to admit changed your life?

(I‚Äôll also accept a course, movie, person, whatever)

for me, I‚Äôll go with ‚ÄúMastery‚Äù by Robert Greene

I was mad inspired by the attitude of mastery as a virtue and life project to pursue,,

And put off by the rest of his books, which made my relationship to this one weird

I kinda wanna reread it now and see how it holds up

It turns out after all these years the body is much more prepared to deal with it than it was before.

What's the best book you've ever read that had a bad cover which gave you very low expectations?

Someone gave me this book for my 14th birthday and I thought it would be garbage but it was surprisingly actually pretty good! https://t.co/LEoR2l5uhc

It's been a long time since I read a book that really excited me and felt unputdownable. Based on my vibes, what book do you think might really excite me? Any fiction/non-fiction recommendations welcome ü´∂

RIP Vernor Vinge. One of the authors who influenced me most growing up. He had many contributions and many great novels, and he will be missed. https://t.co/Ekmzg0fFff

# iaimforgoat (April 12, 2023)

This book interesting to me, the first time I've read it I loved it. The 2nd time I (tried to) read I hated it and had to stop.

The difference? I was (super) depressed the first time I've read it.

Now, I am not saying that's the case for everyone, but I find it v interesting. https://t.co/CNFCh5vnKB
